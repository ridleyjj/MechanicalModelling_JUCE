# Mechanical Modelling Audio Plugin #

## Description ##

This repository contains the project files and source code for an audio plugin that I have built using the JUCE framework in order to create synthesised sounds of mechanical objects using physical modelling.

The physical modelling algorithms used in this plugin are based on Andy Farnell's physical models of a fan and of a car motor in his book *Designing Sound*.

A video demo of the plugin in it's current state (ran in standalone mode) can be seen/heard [here](https://vimeo.com/712532071 "Video Demo").
